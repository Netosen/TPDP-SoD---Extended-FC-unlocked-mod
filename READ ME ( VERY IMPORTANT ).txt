		     [ IMPORTANT NOTICE ]

I made this mod without any permission of Barudo and his team.
Any further changes is not made by the SoD - Extended mod team so don't blame them if something wrong happens with your game.
You can find me on TPDP discord, ping me @Netosen.

Features
- Allows you to obtain various bosses and EX puppets from the SoD - Extended mod.
- Also includes Fanchara mod by Wower (no changes).

There are still unobtainable puppets that need to be added in future updates.
- Currently focuses on extended bosses.

================================================================
	 * Mod only exclusive who has SoD extended mod *
		  * For experimental use only *
================================================================

[ FAQ ] (frequently asked question)

Can I use my use my current save file?
- Yes

Where can I find (X) puppet?
- Scroll down a bit and you will find the [ Puppet Locations ] section.

Puppets shows invisible on the overworld
- They don't have a puppet animation, the reason is SoD - Extended don't have this animatios on unobtainable puppets so
  they will appear invisible on the overworld.
	> Might work with that in the future

(X) puppet only showing number on puppet box
- Unobtainable puppets don't have a proper sprite so it's currently numbers, is what shown on SoD - Extended mod.

Can I bring my game back to the original SoD - Extended mod?
- Yes, if you have any help on updating the game check TPDP discord.

Will my puppets dissapear when I update the game back to the original SoD - Extended?
- No, they're still there and usable :D

	> Fanchara puppets will dissapear *if* you use the SoD - Exteded .jar file instead of FC (Fanchara) mod *
	> Any help on bringing your game back to the mod or original DM me on discord. You can also ask how on TPDP discord.

Why is (X) puppet has different move set?
- Extended bosses have a different move set that cannot be obtained on normal puppets, I did not replace any but add it instead.
- Mod is experimental so it can be bring back to original. While in use of (X) skill and upating back to the original
  SoD - Extended mod, skill shows (!) on the left side but works perfectly fine.
	> Skills with (!) mark dissalows you to do netplay

[VERY IMPORTANT] Why is (X) puppet the same puppet as (X)?
- Sod - Extended puppets are compressed into a 3 in 1 puppet, 1 DUMMY(X) puppet contains 3 different styles and outfit.
	> Each style represents a different puppet, Extra (1st), Extra (2nd) and Extra (3rd), each represents a different puppet.
	> Outfit is based on their style, Maribel EX puppet shows what type of costume she uses,  by means that all type doesn't mean that
	  they uses the same outfit.
	* improper use of outfit is not recommended *

	> Example: DUMMY7 is Renko EX and DUMMY7 is Maribel EX - what!?
		- Renko EX has extra style, same to Maribel EX, this is very confusing but I'll make it simple.
		- Renko EX uses the *first (1st)* Extra style while Maribel EX uses the *second (2nd)* extra, same as the outfit.
			> Every puppet in the list shows what ability the syle has, for example DUMMY7 extra (1) has "Fascination" ability then
			  the 2nd extra has "Boundary Savior" ability, they don't share the same ability, each refering to a different puppet.
			> Maribel EX uses normal costume while Renko EX being Alt Color/Alternate.

	> Any further information about this thing you can talk to me on discord.

Where can I message you?
- You can talk to me on discord, Athaza is forgotten#5743.
- You can also find me on TPDP discord, @Netosen.

[ Other mod info ]

Puppets are modified to have the skill of (X) boss puppet. Example Extra Keiki, don't have "Electric Heritage" & "Shooting Press" can
now be obtained by leveling or by spell card.

Updating the game back to the original will cause "Electric Heritage" & "Shooting Press" skills become skills with (!) on the left side,
means that they are used in illegal way and cannot be used during netplay but still useable, skill replacement will cause the skill to
dissapear permanently.

I add their skills on unused skill space, I try not to replace skills as possible.

Puppets that has 2 or more skills that are the same only shows 1 on moveset editing. I added the exact replica of the skill but it only
allows you to use no more than one at a time.
	> Game code

Updating your game back to the original makes the (modified) puppets loose their skills leaving [!] on the left side of the skill. Having
this makes you ineligiable for netplay.
